# Welcome to Catchet
> Catchet is a browser game where you battle other players with cards and try to collect all the catchlets (characters). This game focuses on the community with an auction house, battling, and more!

Well, I don't really know how you stumbled onto this GitHub page, unless you were actively looking for it (or you did infact just stumble on it), but we don't offer that much here. All of our content is on our [Discord](https://discord.catchet.org) and on our [game](https://catchet.org) itself.
